# Windows Scripts

### Decrapifier :hankey:

**!!Use this script at your own risk!!**

A fresh Windows install comes with tons of bloatware that are either installed software or background services.
This script removes programs that are not needed for daily usage. The script removes 
or disables services that are using up unnecessary Memory and CPU or are privacy-intrusive.
