# Visual Studio Code Customization

### Missing 'Open in VSCode' option from context menus in Windows

In case you installed `VSCode` and forgot to fill the _'Add VSCode to conext menu'_
checkboxes in the wizard.
Check the version of the `VSCode` installed because paths might differ!
Run the script `AddVSCodeToContextMenu.reg` to add the context menu items.
